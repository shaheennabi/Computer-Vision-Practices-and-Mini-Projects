# Computer Vision Exploration & Experiments

Welcome to my **Computer Vision** repository — a collection of projects and experiments exploring the full spectrum of computer vision, from image processing and feature extraction to advanced model development.

This space covers key concepts such as convolutions, padding, strides, pooling, and model-building. It includes work on image classification, object detection, segmentation, tracking, pose estimation, and generative models like autoencoders and VAEs. MLOps practices are also integrated for reproducibility and deployment.
