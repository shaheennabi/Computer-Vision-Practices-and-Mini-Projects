# Computer-Vision-Practices-and-Mini-Projects
### This repository is dedicated to exploring and experimenting with various computer vision techniques, including:

* Algorithm Practice: Training and testing the latest object detection, segmentation, tracking, and pose estimation models etc.
  
* Mathematical Exploration: Understanding and applying the mathematics behind computer vision algorithms.

* Latest Models: Experimenting with cutting-edge models in the computer vision field as they are released.
  
* Mini-Projects: Building small-scale projects focused on practical applications of computer vision techniques.
  
* Research Paper Implementation: Exploring and implementing various research papers from scratch to understand and apply novel techniques.
  
* MLOps Experiments: Building mini-projects that incorporate MLOps practices, focusing on reproducibility, deployment, and monitoring for computer vision models.

* GANs, VAEs, and Autoencoders: Implementing Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and other autoencoder-based architectures from scratch.
  
  ### This repository will be regularly updated with new experiments, research paper implementations, and mini-projects.
