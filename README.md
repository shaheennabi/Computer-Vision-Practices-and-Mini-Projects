# Repository about my proof of work in Computer Vision field. I love to extract features from images, and image processing etc 

* This repository focuses on exploring and experimenting with various computer vision techniques, including training and testing object detection, segmentation, tracking, and pose estimation models, applying mathematical concepts, experimenting with the latest models, building mini-projects, implementing research papers, developing GANs, VAEs, and autoencoders from scratch, and incorporating MLOps practices for reproducibility, deployment, and monitoring.

  ### This repository will be regularly updated with new experiments, research paper implementations, and mini-projects.
